# `@ramda/types`

Official types library for ramda

`@types/ramda` has been community driven for a long time. It is however very incomplete. The goal is this library is to improve the overall types for ramda owned by the ramda team

This repo started off with what was in `@types/ramda` at the time of creation, and improvements have been made since

The plan is to `@types/ramda` simply re-export this lib, and eventually, this lib will be integrated directly into the core `ramda` library.
