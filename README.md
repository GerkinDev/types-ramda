# `@ramda/types`

**This Repo is very very much a Work in Progress**

## Official types library for ramda

`@types/ramda` has been community driven for a long time. It is however very incomplete. The goal is this library is to improve the overall types for ramda by moving ownership in-house

The end-goal is to eventually migration this repo into the core ramda repo, but for now, so we can independently update and release new typings,
this repo will house the types, be publish to `npm` where `@types/ramda` will re-export what is here

To get a sense of what migration back into the core repo will look like, check out `ts` branch that is there now.

Please see the Github Issues page which is being used to define work left to do
