# `@ramda/types`

**This Repo is very very much a Work in Progress**

## Official types library for ramda

`@types/ramda` has been community driven for a long time. It is however very incomplete. The goal is this library is to improve the overall types for ramda owned by the ramda team

Currently, we are continuing to add to and adjust `@types/ramda` until we can do the following:

* Fully migrate all types here
* Publish this package
* Update `@types/ramda` to just re-export this package

The reason for the re-export is so we can deal with all MRs internally for all the improvements that are needed

The current state of this repo is just a copy from what was in the `ts` branch of `ramda/ramda`, re-arranged so it's just the types

The eventual goal is to migrate this repo *into* the core repo like how the `ts` branch is now

Please see the Github Issues page which is being used to define work left to do
